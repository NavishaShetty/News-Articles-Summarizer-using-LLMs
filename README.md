# News-Articles-Summarizer-using-LLMs
Developed a News Articles Summarizer using LangChain and LLM endpoints (OpenAI - GPT-4 and Huggingface - T5), streamlining content extraction and summarization. Enhanced with bulleted and multilingual summary capabilities, for diverse audience needs.

First, we obtain the article data, including the title and text. We then prepare a template for the prompt we want to give to the AI model. This prompt is designed to simulate a conversation with the model, telling it that it's an "advanced AI assistant" and giving it a specific task - to summarize the article into a bulleted list in French.
Once the template is ready, we load the GPT-4 model using ChatOpenAI class with a certain temperature setting, which influences the randomness of the model's outputs. We then format the prompt using the article data.
The core part of the process is when we pass the formatted prompt to the model. The model parses the prompt, understands the task, and generates a summary accordingly. It uses its vast knowledge, trained on diverse internet text, to comprehend and summarize the article in French.
Lastly, the generated summary, which is a response from the model, is printed. The summary is expected to be a concise, bullet-point version of the article in French, just as we instructed the model in the prompt.
In essence, we are guiding the model using natural language instructions to generate the desired output. This interaction is akin to how we might ask a human assistant to perform a task, making it a powerful and intuitive solution for a variety of applications.
